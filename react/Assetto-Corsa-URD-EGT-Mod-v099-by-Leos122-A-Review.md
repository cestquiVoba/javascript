One of the most popular and high-quality mods for Assetto Corsa is the URD EGT mod by United Racing Design. This mod adds a pack of endurance racing cars based on the real-life FIA World Endurance Championship (WEC) and IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship (IWSC) series. The mod features six different car models: Aston Martin Vantage GTE (Arthur Merlin), BMW M8 GTE (Bayro EGT), Chevrolet Corvette C7.R (Venom EGT), Ferrari 488 GTE (Ferruccio EGT), Ford GT GTE (Detroit EGT) and Porsche 911 RSR (Darche EGT).
 
The URD EGT mod is a paid mod that costs â¬6.80 on the United Racing Design website. However, there is also a free version of the mod that was released by Leos122 on RaceDepartment. This version is called Assetto.Corsa.URD.EGT.Mod.v099.Leos122 and it includes all six car models with updated physics, sounds and skins. The mod also works with the latest version of Assetto Corsa (v1.16) and is compatible with Content Manager, a third-party launcher and manager for the game.
