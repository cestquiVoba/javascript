The magazine was named after the year 1997, when Hong Kong was scheduled to be handed over from Britain to China. The magazine reflected the anxieties and aspirations of the Hong Kong people during this period of transition and uncertainty. It also captured the vibrant and cosmopolitan spirit of Hong Kong, which was a hub of trade, finance, and culture in Asia.
 
Hong Kong 97 was widely read by men of different ages and backgrounds, both in Hong Kong and abroad. It had a loyal fan base that collected and traded its issues. Some of its issues are now considered rare and valuable by collectors. The magazine also had a Facebook fan page[^2^] that shared its covers and photos with nostalgic fans.
 
Although Hong Kong 97 ceased publication in the late 1990s, it remains a cult classic among men's magazines. It is remembered for its bold and edgy style, its diverse and engaging content, and its stunning and sexy models. It is a testament to the history and culture of Hong Kong in the 20th century.
  
Hong Kong 97 was founded by Pua Si Loy, a Malaysian-born entrepreneur who moved to Hong Kong in the 1970s. He started the magazine as a hobby, using his own money and contacts. He hired freelance writers, photographers, and models to produce the magazine, which was printed in Taiwan and smuggled into Hong Kong. He also distributed the magazine himself, selling it at newsstands, bookstores, and hotels.
 
The magazine faced many challenges and controversies throughout its history. It was often banned or censored by the authorities for its explicit and inflammatory content. It also faced lawsuits and threats from various parties, such as celebrities, politicians, gangsters, and rival publications. Pua Si Loy was arrested several times and even survived an assassination attempt. Despite these difficulties, he continued to publish the magazine until the late 1990s, when he decided to retire and move to Canada.
 
Hong Kong 97 was not only a magazine, but also a cultural phenomenon. It inspired a video game of the same name[^3^], which is considered one of the worst and most bizarre games ever made. It also influenced other media and art forms, such as films, comics, music, and literature. It was a reflection of the times and the place where it was created: Hong Kong in the 97 era.
  
Hong Kong 97 also had an impact on the political and social landscape of Hong Kong. It was a voice of dissent and criticism against the establishment, both British and Chinese. It exposed the corruption and scandals of the elites, the oppression and injustice of the authorities, and the plight and grievances of the masses. It also advocated for democracy and human rights, and supported the pro-democracy movement that emerged in the late 1980s and early 1990s.
 
The magazine was a reflection of the hopes and fears of the Hong Kong people as they faced an uncertain future under Chinese rule. It expressed their desire for freedom, autonomy, and identity, as well as their anxiety, anger, and frustration. It also captured their sense of humor, creativity, and resilience. It was a testament to the spirit of Hong Kong in the 97 era.
 
However, Hong Kong 97 also faced criticism and controversy for its content and style. Some accused it of being sensationalist, vulgar, sexist, racist, and violent. Some argued that it exploited and objectified women, especially Asian women. Some claimed that it distorted and sensationalized reality, and spread misinformation and propaganda. Some questioned its credibility and ethics as a journalistic publication.
 
Hong Kong 97 was not a perfect magazine, nor was it a representative of all Hong Kong people. It was a product of its time and place, with its own strengths and weaknesses. It was a magazine that challenged and entertained, provoked and inspired, informed and amused. It was a magazine that left a mark on Hong Kong's history and culture.
